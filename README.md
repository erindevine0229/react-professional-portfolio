# erin-devine-professional-portfolio

## Description

This is a React professional portfolio website designed to showcase several recent projects and give a description about myself as a developer. The site features several links to GitHub projects, my resume and a functional contact me form to get in touch. The web application has been designed with media queries to make it mobile responsive on a smaller width screen. 

Below are some examples of the web and mobile views:
